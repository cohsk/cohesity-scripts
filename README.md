# cohesity-scripts
This project has a script I wrote to "jumpstart" my TA labs for Cohesity demos.
The script is setupTA61.ps1

I have the raw code accessible by a bit.ly short URL so that I can quickly access
the raw code in a browser and copy it to a powershell window on the TA lab
jump box.

The bit.ly url is http://bit.ly/myTA61demo

-setupTA61.ps1 note

Adjusted on 5/28/2019 to accomodate v1.0.10 of Cohesity.PowerShell

-To Do

Edit setupTA61.ps1 to automatically run the two modified protection jobs

Will do this once the Cohesity PowerShell cmdlets support replication for on 
demand protection jobs.  ETA is June/July 2019 for this support.
