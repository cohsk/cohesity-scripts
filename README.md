Some utility scripts for Cohesity Clusters

I started writing some scripts to setup TA labs the way I like them

-setupTA61.ps1 note
A new version of Cohesity.PowerShell (version 1.0.10) was published on GitHub on 5/28/2019.
Changes in 1.0.10 caused an error.  I adjusted the script to only use 1.0.9 for now.
Will work on "fixing" the setupTA61.ps1 script to work properly with v1.0.10 soon.
